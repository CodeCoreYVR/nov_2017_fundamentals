// Single quotes and double quotes are effectively the same, it's convenient
// to use double quotes if the string contain '
"He said it's raining"

//                         we can escape the character by putting \ before it
'He said it\'s raining'

// defining strings with backtick is an ES6 feature, we can do what's called
// String interpolation with backticks which means that we can insert pieces
// of code within the string
